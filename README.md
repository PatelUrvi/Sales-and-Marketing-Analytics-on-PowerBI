This project is a Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, analyzing data from the Global Superstore dataset for the years 2012-2015. The dashboard provides several insights such as monitoring total sales, product quantity, average delivery days, and total return orders. It also identifies the top 10 customers, allowing for special discounts to be given. The dashboard further helps identify profit and loss based on the product name, as well as Sales by Segment, Market, and Region, allowing for focused efforts in those areas. This project showcases proficiency in data analytics and the use of Microsoft Power BI.
